                The sun rises over Srinagar just like it does everywhere else. But for thousands of young Kashmiris locked in cells—some without a single credible piece of evidence against them—that sunrise feels like a distant memory.
            </p>

            <p>
                This isn't a story you'll find in mainstream headlines. This is about the young voices that have been silenced, the futures that have been erased, and the mothers who still don't know what their sons have done wrong. Welcome to the world of arbitrary detention in Kashmir.
            </p>

            <h2>The Scale of the Crisis: Numbers That Demand Answers</h2>
            <p>
                Before we talk about the faces behind the bars, we need to understand the staggering reality of the numbers.
            </p>

            <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-10 not-prose">
                <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-lg border-l-4 border-rose-600">
                    <h4 class="text-gray-500 text-sm font-bold uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">UAPA Conviction Rate (J&K)</h4>
                    <p class="text-4xl font-display font-bold text-slate-900">0.8%</p>
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Only 10 convictions out of 1,206 arrests in 2023.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-lg border-l-4 border-slate-600">
                    <h4 class="text-gray-500 text-sm font-bold uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">Detained Outside Kashmir</h4>
                    <p class="text-4xl font-display font-bold text-slate-900">408+</p>
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">People currently held in jails in UP and Haryana, far from families.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                When you arrest more people than you can convict, when you hold over 1,000 people in out-of-state jails, and when conviction rates plummet to less than 1%—you're not just fighting terrorism. You're institutionalizing injustice.
            </p>

            <h2>The Tools of Oppression</h2>
            <p>
                Two laws dominate this landscape:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Safety Act (PSA):</strong> Allows detention for up to <strong>two years without trial</strong>. No judge. No jury. Amnesty International calls it a "lawless law."</li>
                <li><strong>UAPA:</strong> The strict anti-terror law where bail is nearly impossible. Kashmir accounts for 37% of all UAPA cases nationwide, yet holds a conviction rate far lower than the national average.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Their Stories: The Human Cost</h2>

            <h3>Aasif Sultan: The Journalist Who Waited</h3>
            <p>
                Aasif spent <strong>five years</strong> in jail. When a court finally said there was no evidence linking him to militants, he was released. Four hours later, he was re-arrested under a different case. His crime? Publishing stories the state didn't like.
            </p>

            <h3>Khurram Parvez: The Defender Detained</h3>
            <p>
                Khurram Parvez has documented human rights abuses for 20 years. In 2021, the NIA raided his home. He has now spent <strong>over three years</strong> in detention without trial. His offense? Speaking truth to power.
            </p>

            <h3>Afaan Mustafa: A Child's Trauma</h3>
            <p>
                14-year-old Afaan was picked up on his way to prayers. For 13 days, he was held, beaten, and forced to clean police kitchens. No evidence was ever presented. He returned home broken, his childhood stolen by a system that treats minors as threats.
            </p>

            <h2>What the Supreme Court Just Said</h2>
            <blockquote class="bg-rose-50 border-rose-500">
                "We understand the sensitivity of the matter... but facts have to be there to support the allegations."
                <br>— <cite>Supreme Court of India, Jan 2026</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This statement regarding the <strong>Shabir Ahmed Shah</strong> case—where the NIA failed to produce hard evidence after 6 years of detention—is a ray of light. It validates what Kashmiri families have been saying for years: <em>Where is the proof?</em>
            </p>

            <h2>A Mother's Question</h2>
            <p>
                Somewhere in Srinagar, a mother is waiting. She doesn't know the legal jargon of PSA or UAPA. She just wants to know: <em>What crime has he committed? When will my son come home?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                These questions deserve answers. Not tomorrow. Not after another year of detention. Now.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Kashmir's youth are being forgotten by a justice system that has lost its way. The 0.8% conviction rate isn't just a statistic; it's proof of a system collapsed under its own arbitrariness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Until real justice—built on evidence, not suspicion—is restored, the bars will remain full, and the mothers will keep waiting.
            </p>
