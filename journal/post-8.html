          <strong>April 22, 2025</strong>, marked a dark milestone in India's
          security history. The serene Baisaran Valley in Pahalgam—a place where
          newlyweds celebrated love and families created memories—became a
          graveyard.
        </p>

        <p>
          In minutes, the bullets that silenced 26 lives also silenced the
          valley's economic engines. This wasn't just another terror attack.
          This was a calculated blow to Kashmir's fragile recovery. The economic
          catastrophe that followed reveals a brutal truth:
          <strong
            >security incidents don't just kill people. They destroy
            livelihoods.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <h2>A Region on the Brink of Revival</h2>
        <p>
          To understand the devastation, we must first understand what was lost.
          Before April 22, 2025, Kashmir was experiencing unprecedented economic
          recovery.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2024 Arrivals:</strong> 2.36 crore tourists.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>GDP Share:</strong> Tourism contributed 7-8% of Kashmir's
            GDP (₹21,200 crore).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Momentum:</strong> Srinagar's Tulip Garden attracted 8.14
            lakh visitors in just 26 days.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The valley wasn't just recovering. It was booming. Young entrepreneurs
          borrowed money to buy taxis and renovate hotels. Families bet their
          futures on this momentum. Then came April 22.
        </p>

        <h2>The Immediate Collapse</h2>
        <p>
          The aftermath was swift. Within 48 hours,
          <strong>90% of bookings were cancelled</strong>. Hotels operating at
          capacity saw occupancy drop to single digits.
        </p>
        <p>
          By October 2025, six months later,
          <strong>95% of Kashmir's 200,000 hotel beds were empty</strong>. One
          hotel manager summed it up:
          <em
            >"We went from earning ₹1 crore during peak season to barely
            scraping together ₹50,000."</em
          >
        </p>

        <figure

            rates in the six months following the attack.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>The Employment Tsunami</h2>
        <p>Tourism is an ecosystem. When it stops, everything stops.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>90,000+ individuals</strong> rendered unemployed.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>600+ taxi drivers</strong> in Pahalgam alone left idle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1,000+ commercial vehicles</strong> became depreciating
            liabilities.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Mohammad Ali</strong>, a driver with 20 years of experience,
          lost ₹5 lakh in earnings. His vehicle sat parked, a growing debt
          burden. The
          <strong>All Kashmir Houseboat Owners Association</strong> reported
          that investments taking a generation to build were being sold off in
          distress.
        </p>

        <h2>The Debt Trap: When Business Becomes a Burden</h2>
        <p>
          The cruelest irony is that those who took the biggest risks—investing
          in hotels and taxis via loans—were hit the hardest.
        </p>
        <p>
          With occupancy at zero, EMIs couldn't be paid. Families sold ancestral
          land and jewelry to satisfy banks. In July 2025, the J&K High Court
          ruled in favor of banks seizing mortgaged property under the SARFAESI
          Act, intensifying the fear among local entrepreneurs.
        </p>

        <h2>The Destination Closures</h2>
        <p>
          Adding insult to injury, the government sealed off
          <strong>48 of 87 major tourist destinations</strong> including
          Doodhpathri, Yousmarg, and Aharbal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even by January 2026, nine months later, Doodhpathri remained
          effectively closed. The message sent to the world was clear:
          <em>Kashmir is not safe. Kashmir is still shut down.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Collateral Damage: Economy-Wide Crisis</h2>
        <p>
          The crash triggered a domino effect. Handicrafts, horticulture, and
          retail all suffered.
        </p>

        <figure
          class="my-10 border-2 border-emerald-50 rounded-3xl overflow-hidden shadow-xl"
        >
          <img
            src="../images/sectoral-losses-graph.jpg"
            alt="Graph showing economic losses across handicrafts, horticulture and transport"
            class="w-full"
          />
          <figcaption class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 p-4 bg-gray-50">
            Figure 2: Breakdown of economic losses across Handicrafts,
            Horticulture, Retail, and Transport sectors.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <strong>The Multiplier Effect:</strong> Every rupee spent by a tourist
          generates ₹3.11 in the local economy. With direct revenue losses of
          ₹2,700 crore, the
          <strong
            >total economic loss is estimated at over ₹10,000 crore.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <h2>The Current State: January 2026</h2>
        <p>
          As of today, the situation remains dire. While Chief Minister Omar
          Abdullah has unveiled new tourism calendars and some spots like Drang
          have reopened, recovery is slow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Debt crises continue. Youth unemployment remains above 30%. The "safe
          destination" narrative has evaporated.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "First it was the conflict that took opportunities from us. Now it's
          fear. Both steal our future."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Human Truth</h2>
        <p>
          Nine months later, Pahalgam's main bazaar is quiet. But there is
          resilience. In early January, a cab driver named
          <strong>Gulam Nabi</strong> returned a tourist's lost iPhone and cash.
          The story went viral.
        </p>
        <p>
          It symbolized what Kashmiris want the world to know:
          <strong
            >We are still here. We are still honest. We are still
            welcoming.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Recovery will be slow and painful. But the question is not whether
          Kashmir will recover. The question is:
          <em
            >What kind of economy will emerge? Will it be resilient, or will it
            repeat the same fragilities?</em
          >
