          On April 22, 2025, terror struck Pahalgam. Twenty-six innocent souls
          lost their lives. It was a tragedy that shook the valley. But today,
          nine months later, while Pahalgam has healed, a shadow extends far
          beyond it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Three names haunt the tourism industry:
          <strong>Yousmarg. Doodhpathri. Tosamaidan.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not merely a story about closed tourist sites. This is a story
          about forgotten people, about families forced into starvation, and
          about a silence that has lasted 270 days.
        </p>

            (April 2025 - Jan 2026)
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>The Places: Kashmir's Hidden Jewels</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Doodhpathri (Valley of Milk):</strong> Perched at 8,957 feet,
          it transforms into a white paradise in winter. Now, the silence there
          carries the weight of absence. <br /><br />
          <strong>Yousmarg (Meadow of Dreams):</strong> Its economy is almost
          entirely tourism-driven. Youth here stopped migrating to cities to
          build futures in their mountains. Those futures have been erased.
        </p>
        <p>
          These places share a geographic irony: they are located nowhere near
          Pahalgam. Yet they remain closed. Nine months. Approaching a year of
          devastation.
        </p>

        <h2>The People Behind the Silence</h2>
        <p>
          We often reduce economic collapse to statistics. But behind every
          closure lies flesh and blood.
        </p>

        <h3>The Pony Handler: Abdul Rashid</h3>
        <p>
          "This is our only season to earn," he said in July. That was six
          months ago. Nine months without income means no food for horses, no
          school fees for children. It is absolute destitution.
        </p>

        <h3>The Desperation Speaks</h3>
        <p>
          In a video that should haunt every decision-maker, a Yousmarg resident
          cried out:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "We have become very desperate now... Now we will talk about burning
          ourselves. Please accept our request. We are forced into starvation.
          Our children have been withdrawn from school."
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is not a threat. It is the final cry of someone drowning.</p>

        <h2>The Great Geographic Irony</h2>
        <p>
          Here lies the fundamental absurdity:
          <strong>Pahalgam itself reopened in June 2025.</strong> Gulmarg never
          closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why do destinations 110km away from the attack site remain frozen? No
          timeline has been provided. No criteria articulated. This isn't
          security policy; it is bureaucratic negligence.
        </p>

        <h2>The Silence of Leadership</h2>
        <p>
          Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has expressed frustration, noting that
          "decisions to close tourist destinations are taken without consulting
          elected government."
        </p>
        <p>
          But his silence on the <strong>human tragedy</strong> is deafening. He
          has not visited Yousmarg. He has not demanded an emergency relief
          package. The elected government seems caught between authority and
          helplessness, while the people starve.
        </p>

            Closed for 9 Months
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>The Path Forward: What Must Happen Now</h2>
        <p>The government must act immediately:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Transparent Risk Assessment:</strong> Explain
            <em>why</em> these specific places are closed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Concrete Timeline:</strong> Give the people a date.
            Uncertainty is torture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Emergency Relief:</strong> Provide financial aid for the 9
            months of lost income. This is not charity; it is responsibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community Engagement:</strong> The Chief Minister must visit
            these families.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion: The Forgotten Tragedy</h2>
        <p>
          The April 22 attack was a tragedy caused by terror. The closure of
          Yousmarg is a tragedy caused by bureaucracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nine months have passed. Today is January 25, 2026. Pahalgam heals.
          Gulmarg thrives. But in Yousmarg, pony handlers wonder how to feed
          their horses.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is time to open these doors. Not eventually. Not after more
          assessments. <strong>Now.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The mountains have been silent long enough.</p>
