          Jammu and Kashmir stands at a crossroads. While the rest of the nation
          grapples with the complexities of modern economic growth, this region
          faces something far more urgent—a crisis that silently erodes the
          hopes and futures of millions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The unemployment situation in Kashmir has evolved from a statistical
          anomaly to a defining characteristic of the region's economy. It is no
          longer just a number; it is a human tragedy.

            Figure 1: Unemployment Rate Comparison: Jammu & Kashmir vs National
            Average (2024-2025)
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>The Numbers Don't Lie</h2>
        <p>
          The magnitude of this crisis becomes starkly apparent when we examine
          the data. Kashmir's headline unemployment rate stands at
          <strong>6.1%</strong>, seemingly modest compared to global standards
          but profoundly alarming against India's national average of 5.2%.
        </p>
        <p>
          But averages hide the pain. In urban centers, the rate surges to a
          jarring <strong>10.6%</strong>. More devastatingly, among young women
          aged 15 to 29 in cities, the unemployment rate reaches an astonishing
          <strong>20.8%</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>A Demographic Catastrophe</h2>
        <p>
          While the national male unemployment rate hovers around 5.2%,
          Kashmir's figure is lower. But this masks a deeper tragedy: women and
          youth bear the brunt.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Urban Women:</strong> 20.8% unemployment (Triple the
            national average).
          </li>
          <li><strong>Rural Women:</strong> 23% unemployment.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Urban Youth (15-29):</strong> 32% unemployment. One in every
            three young people is without work.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are not uneducated individuals. They are engineers, educators,
          and postgraduates forced to take up positions as tailors or home-based
          workers, their degrees hanging on walls as cruel reminders of
          unfulfilled potential.
        </p>

        <h2>The Policy Betrayal: How Local Industry Was Dismantled</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most insidious causes lies in a bureaucratic change. After
          2019, the government shifted procurement to the
          <strong>Government e-Marketplace (GeM)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, local manufacturers had a natural advantage. Overnight,
          they were forced to compete with giants from Gujarat and Maharashtra.
          The result? In 2024, when Srinagar needed electrical poles, they were
          bought from Jharkhand despite local factories sitting idle just down
          the road.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "40.82% of industrial units in Kashmir are now 'sick'—a technical term
          for broken dreams and closed factories."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Agricultural Collapse</h2>
        <p>
          For centuries, agriculture was the backbone. Today, it is collapsing.
          Kashmir has lost nearly <strong>34,000 hectares</strong> of farmland
          since 1996.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why? Because it doesn't pay. A paddy farmer earns as little as ₹1,500
          per hectare. With returns so thin, the decision to abandon farming is
          not a choice; it is survival. But the secondary sector hasn't grown to
          absorb these workers, leaving them in limbo.
        </p>

        <h2>The Government Job Mirage</h2>
        <p>
          In the absence of a private sector, youth pin their hopes on
          government jobs. But even this lifeline is fraying. 10,000 employees
          retire annually, but recruitment lags far behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ifrat Rashid</strong>, a woman with two postgraduate degrees,
          waits years for a job that never comes, eventually turning to
          tailoring. She represents a generation whose education has been
          rendered nearly worthless by the market.
        </p>

        <h2>The Human Cost: Beyond Statistics</h2>
        <p>
          Behind every percentage point is a story of despair. Mental health
          crises are sweeping the valley. Substance abuse has emerged as a
          coping mechanism for young men emasculated by financial dependence.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then there is the <strong>Brain Drain</strong>. The brightest
          minds—doctors, engineers, thinkers—are leaving. Their departure is not
          just a loss of talent; it is a loss of hope.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion: A Call for Urgent Action</h2>
        <p>
          The unemployment crisis is not inevitable; it is the consequence of
          policy choices. Solving it requires more than cosmetic changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to protect local industry. We need to revive agriculture. We
          need to align education with market reality. Until then, the youth of
          Kashmir will continue to wait—for jobs that don't materialize, for
          opportunities that pass them by.
        </p>
        <p>
          A generation's potential is being squandered. And that is a loss not
          just for Kashmir, but for humanity.
