                Yesterday, the results for Class 10 and 12 were declared. And just like clockwork, the circus began. The sweets, the firecrackers, the Facebook statuses. But amidst the noise of celebration, a quiet tragedy occurred.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a village not far from here, a young boy hanged himself.
            </p>

            <p>
                He didn't die because he wasn't intelligent. He died because he couldn't face the "hype." He died because we, as a society, have turned a routine academic update into a life-or-death verdict.
            </p>

            <h2>The Gazette Era vs. The Digital Circus</h2>
            <p>
                Let's rewind 30 or 40 years. Back then, passing Matriculation was genuinely rare. The pass percentage in a typical village school hovered below 40%. There were no smartphones, no internet. You waited for the "Gazette"—a thick book of numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                If three boys in a village appeared for the exam, likely two would fail. The one who passed—even with a rank of 440 out of 600—was a hero. The celebration made sense because the achievement was scarce.
            </p>

            <h2>The Inflation of Success</h2>
            <p>
                Today, the landscape is unrecognizable. The pass rate is consistently above 85%. Distinctions are distributed like confetti.
            </p>
            <p>
                This year alone, there was a <strong>16% relaxation</strong> in the syllabus. That translates to roughly <strong>60 marks gifted</strong> out of 500. Passing has never been easier. Academically, a "distinction" today holds a fraction of the value it did decades ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, the social hysteria has not decreased; it has multiplied.
            </p>

            <h2>The Toxic "Relative" Syndrome</h2>
            <p>
                Why are we still beating drums? Because it's no longer about education. It's about ego.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's about the neighbor who needs to prove their child is superior to yours. It's about the relative who calls not to congratulate, but to compare. <em>"Aur, tuhundis koot aav?"</em> (And, how much did yours get?) is not a question of concern; it is a weapon.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "We are not celebrating their success. We are celebrating our own vanity. And in the process, we are crushing the souls of those who stumble."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Blood on Our Hands</h2>
            <p>
                The boy who took his life didn't fail an exam. He failed our expectations. He looked at the WhatsApp statuses, the Facebook posts, the sweets being distributed next door, and he felt he had no place in this world.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is on us.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is on the parents who treat marks as a status symbol. It is on the neighbors who judge worth by a percentage. It is on a society that has forgotten that education is about learning, not a scorecard.
            </p>

            <h2>A Plea for Sanity</h2>
            <p>
                Stop the firecrackers. Stop the public shaming. Stop posting marksheets on social media as if they are trophies of war.
            </p>
            <p>
                To the parents: Your child is more than a number. A sheet of paper cannot define their destiny.
                <br>To the neighbors: Mind your own business.
                <br>To the students: You are enough. This exam is a tiny blip in a long life.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is time we felt shame—not for the students who fail, but for the society that fails them.
            </p>
