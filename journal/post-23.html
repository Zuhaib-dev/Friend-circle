          Deep in the Zabarwan range, just 22 kilometers from the chaos of
          Srinagar, lies a sanctuary called Dachigam. It is the last fortress of
          a king who has lost his kingdom.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <strong>Hangul</strong> (Kashmir Stag) is not just an animal. It
          is the state animal of Jammu & Kashmir. It is the only surviving
          subspecies of Red Deer in the entire Indian subcontinent. It is
          majestic, with antlers that reach for the sky like branches of an
          ancient Chinar.
        </p>

        <p>
          But today, the king is dying. From a population of over 5,000 in the
          early 1900s, fewer than <strong>300</strong> remain. They are the
          ghosts of the mountains, fading into memory before our very eyes.
        </p>

        <h2>The Collapse: A Century of Loss</h2>
        <p>
          The decline of the Hangul is a tragedy written in slow motion. The
          latest census (2023) showed a marginal increase to roughly
          <strong>289 individuals</strong>, but this number is precariously low.
          For a species to be genetically viable, it needs a population far
          larger.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1900s:</strong> ~5,000 Hangul roamed from Karen to Kishtwar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1970:</strong> Population crashed to ~150 due to poaching.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2026:</strong> Still hovering below 300, confined largely to
            Dachigam.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why is the Hangul Dying?</h2>
        <p>
          The Hangul isn't dying of old age. It is being squeezed out of
          existence by human greed and mismanagement.
        </p>

        <h3>1. The Cement Dust of Khrew</h3>
        <p>
          Just outside the sanctuary lies the industrial hub of Khrew, home to
          massive cement factories. The dust from these plants settles on the
          leaves and grass in the Hangul's habitat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine eating food coated in cement dust every day. This causes
          respiratory issues and long-term health decline in the deer
          population. The pristine air of the sanctuary is tainted by the gray
          smog of industry.
        </p>

        <h3>2. The Sheep Farm Occupation</h3>
        <p>
          For decades, a government-run sheep breeding farm occupied a massive
          chunk of Dachigam's core area. While it has recently been relocated
          after years of activism, the damage to the habitat—overgrazing and
          competition for fodder—has been severe.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "We protected the sheep to feed humans, while the stag starved in its
          own home."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>3. Habitat Fragmentation</h3>
        <p>
          The Hangul is a migratory animal. Historically, it moved to the upper
          reaches in summer and lower valleys in winter. Today, that corridor is
          blocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Urban sprawl, golf courses, and roads have cut off their ancient
          migratory routes. The animals are trapped in an island of protected
          forest, leading to inbreeding and vulnerability to predators like
          leopards and black bears.
        </p>

        <h2>The Conservation Paradox</h2>
        <p>
          Efforts have been made. The "Project Hangul" was launched in the
          1970s. Captive breeding centers were established at Shikargah. But
          success has been elusive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why? Because you cannot save a species in a zoo if its home is
          burning. The focus has often been on numbers, not on habitat
          restoration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the male-female ratio and the fawn survival rate remain
          alarming. For every 100 females, there are only about 12-15 males.
          Without a healthy gender balance, the population cannot bounce back.
        </p>

        <h2>The Unsung Heroes</h2>
        <p>
          Amidst the gloom, there are heroes. The forest guards of Dachigam walk
          miles in deep snow, tracking the animals, checking for poachers, and
          conducting the census.
        </p>
        <p>
          Researchers like <strong>Dr. Mukesh Thakur</strong> and local wildlife
          experts have dedicated their lives to studying the Hangul's genetics,
          proving it is a distinct species deserving of the highest protection
          status globally.
        </p>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          You might ask:
          <em
            >"We have unemployment, drug crises, and political issues. Why care
            about a deer?"</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the Hangul is the barometer of our ecosystem. If the Hangul
          dies, it means our forests are sick. If our forests are sick, our
          water sources—which originate in these protected areas—will fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hangul is also a symbol of Kashmir's unique identity. It exists
          nowhere else on Earth. Losing it would be like losing the Chinar or
          the Jhelum. It is an erasure of who we are.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion: A Roar in the Silence</h2>
        <p>
          October is the rutting season. If you stand quietly in Lower Dachigam,
          you might hear the "rut"—the powerful, haunting roar of the male
          Hangul calling out to a mate.
        </p>
        <p>That roar is becoming fainter every year.</p>
        <p>
          We are the generation that will decide the fate of this species. Will
          the Hangul become a myth we tell our grandchildren about? Or will we
          give it the space, the silence, and the respect it needs to thrive
          again?
        </p>
        <p>The Ghost of Dachigam is watching us. Let us not fail it.</p>
